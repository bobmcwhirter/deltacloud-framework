Hooray, you've successfully checked out the framework.

Now you need to check out a driver or two alongside it.

Might as well go ahead and check everything out, so you end up with:

  deltacloud/
    deltacloud-framework/
    deltacloud-driver-ec2/
    deltacloud-driver-rhevm/
    deltacloud-driver-mock/
    deltacloud-client-ruby/

We're going to assume you're using the mock driver, though.

In deltacloud-framework/config/environment.rb, near the bottom, ensure it says

	DRIVER=:mock

In deltacloud-client/ run "rake fixtures" to install some mock test data.

Back in detlacloud-framework/, run it like a normal rails app.  If you have other
rails apps running, just pick another port

    ./script/server             # implies port 3000
    ./script/server -p 3001     # runs on port 3001

To sanity-check, you can run the client specs from deltacloud-client-ruby/

	rake spec

If you're running the framework on not-localhost or not-port-3000, you can use
environment variables to point the specs at the right place

	API_PORT=3001 rake spec

	API_HOST=laptop.local rake spec

The specs in deltacloud-client-ruby/specs/**_spec.rb are useful examples of how 
to use the client.
